    "The network we built in Part 1 is dumb, it doesn't know anything about our handwritten digits. Neural networks with non-linear activations work like universal function approximators. There is some function that maps your input to the output. For example, images of handwritten digits to class probabilities. The power of neural networks is that we can train them to approximate this function, and basically any function given enough data and compute time.\n",

    "At first the network is naive, it doesn't know the function mapping the inputs to the outputs. We train the network by showing it examples of real data, then adjusting the network parameters such that it approximates this function.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find these parameters, we need to know how poorly the network is predicting the real outputs. For this we calculate a **loss function** (also called the cost), a measure of our prediction error. For example, the mean squared loss is often used in regression and binary classification problems\n",

We find this minimum using a process called **gradient descent**. The gradient is the slope of the loss function and points in the direction of fastest change. To get to the minimum in the least amount of time, we then want to follow the gradient (downwards). You can think of this like descending a mountain by following the steepest slope to the base.\n",

By using weight sharing - multiple units with the same weights - convolutional layers are able to learn repeated patterns in your data. For example, a unit could learn the pattern for an eye, or a face, or lower level features like edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, convolutional layers are followed by max-pooling, where values in the convolutional layer are aggregated into a smaller layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='assets/Pooling_Simple_max.png' width=600px>\n",
    "\n",
    "These types of networks become really useful when you stack a bunch of layers, you make the network *deeper*. Typically you'll use a convolutional layer to change the depth, ReLU activation, then a max-pooling layer to reduce the height and width.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='assets/conv_net.jpg' width=600px>\n",
    "\n",
    "To finish off the network, you need to flatten the final convolutional layer into a normal fully-connected (dense) layer, then add more fully-connected layers as a classifier. The convolutional layers act as feature detectors that the classifier uses as inputs. Convolutional networks have been massively effective in image classification, object recognition, and even in natural language processing applications like speech generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building this new network is pretty much the same as before, but we use `nn.Conv2d` for the convolutional layers and `nn.MaxPool2d` for the max-pooling layer. (Although max-pooling has fallen out of favor recently, but this is traditional so let's stick with it.)\n",
    "\n",
    "So here I'll build a convolutional network with two convolutional layers, with ReLU activations, and max-pooling after each. The first convolutional layer will have a depth of 10, use a 5x5 kernel, with a stride of 1 (so no downsampling). The second convolutional layer will have a depth of 20, use a 5x5 kernel, and a stride of 1 again. Both layers will have \"same\" padding, but it's done differently here than in TensorFlow. Instead of saying we want \"same\" padding and letting the framework pad the input tensors, we define how much padding we want on the tensors. The padding should be set to 2 then, since we are using 5x5 kernels and we want the center of the kernel to lie on the edges of the images. Then, there will be two pixels of the kernel falling over the edge of the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll flatten the final convolutional layer and pass it to a fully connected layer. We can change the shape of the Variable `x` with `x.view`. This is then passed to the fully connected layer, which then goes to the output layer with 10 units."
